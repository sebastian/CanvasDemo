# Canvas demo

Quick demo to show how one could go about building and draggable
entities on a canvas element.

## Prerequisites

I am using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) to manage the project,
and have installed [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to build the javascript.

So to develop or use:

1. Install `yarn`
1. Run `yarn install`
1. Run `yarn dev`
1. Open [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser
